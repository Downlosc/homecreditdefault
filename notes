TODO:

- homedefault_traintest: move the part from the Pearson correlation onwards to homedefault_feateng

- homedefault_merge : edit the functions 'convert_types' and 'remove_columns' in such a way that
	              they do more or less the same thing but with different syntax, names, since 
		      both are copy and paste from a kaggle notebook (https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/introduction-to-manual-feature-engineering-p2)

- clean the code  (comments, make a module with the defined functions)
